# Facilities Management System Frontend

The Facilities Management System is a modern, Next.js-based web application designed to provide a comprehensive dashboard for facility management operations. Featuring a ARISAN SIFISO-inspired UI with animated cards, interactive charts, and a progress bar, it offers a visually appealing and functional interface for managing strategic intelligence, facilities operations, and service provider dashboards. The project is built with scalability in mind, ready for backend integration to display real-time analytics and metrics.
Features

Hero Section: A visually striking hero with a gradient overlay and inspirational quote, showcasing the system's purpose.
Operations Overview: Interactive Bar and Pie charts (using recharts) displaying completion rates and performance metrics.
Strategic Facilities Intelligence: 9 animated dashboard cards with backdrop-blur-md effects, linking to pages like /strategic-intelligence/sustainability-ledger.
Facilities Management Dashboards: 9 cards with hover effects, linking to pages like /smart-insights.
Service Providers: 5 cards with colored borders, linking to pages like /service-providers/leitch-landscape.
Progress Bar: A loading animation (bprogress) styled with Tailwind CSS, visible for 3 seconds on page load.
Testing: Comprehensive unit tests (Jest) and end-to-end tests (Cypress) for UI and navigation.
Clean Repository: Optimized with .gitignore to exclude build artifacts, reducing tracked files significantly.
